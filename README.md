# 02-Advanced-CSS-Portfolio # My First portfolio
## Introduction:

In this activity we made portfolios from scratch to showcase our working skills and talents for potential employers looking to fill a position. Providing a developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about myself and my work, and how to contact myself.

We created a static website that you can view on this link:[killjoyangel
